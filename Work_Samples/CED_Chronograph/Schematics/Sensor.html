                <h1>This system consists of analog techniques such as light sensors, filtering, voltage regulation and self-calibration, as well as providing a digital output event for the CED M2 ballistic chronograph system</h1>
                <h1>Before this design there were no chronograph sensors that were able to maintain consistent sensitivity in all light levels as well as rejecting things that might cause false readings</h1>
                <h1>I also have heard that this design is the best on the market in its class</h1>
